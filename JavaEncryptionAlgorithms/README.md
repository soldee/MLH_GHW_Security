## Java Encryption algorithms

### Private key encryption
- AES/DES are block methods that operate on bit level. This means it is faster for encrypting large amounts of data.


#### DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- 56-bits
- Easily broken by today's computers

#### AES (Advances Encryption Standard)
- 128-bits, 256, 512, 1024, 2048
- Would require modern computers lots of years to break

### Public key encryption
- Inefficient for big text encryption

#### RSA
